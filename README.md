## Cloning the repo

Use your favourite Git GUI to clone the project down to to local machine

If you perfer to do this in the terminal run `git clone git@github.com:Brian-Kwong/Pawsitive-Studying-.git` in the directory you would like the project to be located in

## Running the Application

Run `npm install` which downloads all the neccessary node packages

This application's front end was built upon the React Native framework so we will need to install a couple more things...

If you're using a Mac you'll also need to install watchman `brew install watchman`[^1]

[^1]: This assumes you have homebrew (the package manager for macOS) installed. If you dont have it installed you can get it [here](https://brew.sh/)

Additionally we will need to get a ExpoGo-- an app that allows us to wirelessly transmit our web application to our mobile device.

[iOSüì±](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779)
[Andriod ‚òéÔ∏è](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1)

Then to start the application navigate to `./Application/Pawsitive-Studying` & run `npx expo start`

Make sure your mobile phone and computer are connected on the same LAN, then scan the QR code.

Accept any permission prompts that may arise from either the computer or device.

If all goes well it should open up in ExpoGo and load your app[^2].
[^2]On first boot it may take a bit to download the code onto the device
